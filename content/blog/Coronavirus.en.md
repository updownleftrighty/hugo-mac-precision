### Notes regarding the situation of our partners 
 
For suppliers and customers alike the Coronavirus-19 has been devastating. Everyone has suffered and many continue to do so if not physically or financially at least emotionally. Our suppliers in Spain went through some very tough weeks at Easter time and the whole country was basically closed. 

Now they are all open with new regulations and practices, but operating and creating new ways to complete orders on time and make up for lost time. There are some delays, but for the most part they are shipping within two weeks of due dates with some orders actually being served on time. 

In this spot would usually appear a list of events and the participation thereof from the various suppliers. Now most events have either been postponed, cancelled or are waiting to determine what they will do. Our suppliers often participate in German trade shows and we are confident this will soon be the case once again. 

In the meantime, some companies have turned to digital means of getting information out about their companies. We hereby announce a plant tour video from the company Ondozabal. Please go to our Partner page to reach the link that will connect you to this excellent video.

Also, should your company have questions or want to have a meeting with either personnel from MAC Precision or one of our suppliers we can arrange to meet at your location or virtually over the internet with Zoom or other AP. We look forward to hearing from you.
