    title : Tradition is in our blood
    description : >
      Our suppliers are all located in the north of Spain either in Catalunya or the Basque Country. They have a 500-year history of being proud of their workmanship and today they add flexibility and reliability to the formula. Without this formula they would have little chance of competing in the German market.
